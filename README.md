## Description

The purpose of this app was to make it easy for a manager to view and edit their employees in a CMS. The app uses node, inquirer and MySQL. The database contains tables for department, role and employee. The UI for this app is found in the command0line and it allows a user to add/view/update departments, roles and employees. Future development will allow for additional views and the ability to delete.
